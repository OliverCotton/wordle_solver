# Wordle Solver

## Overview
Terminal program written to solve wordle puzzles. 

Identifies which words are still possible based upon an initial user guess - and offers the best possible next guess. 

## Improvements to be made
Development stopped once program could successfully generate guesses which consistantly scored no more than 5/6 on wordle problems. There are several areas in which the program could be further improved. These include:
1. currently best guesses are determined through a scoring system. This serves as a proxy for how many possibilities a guess is likely to rule out. It would be better to directly determine this.
2. Easier interface, perhaps with a GUI or directly open wordle and type guesses for the user. 
3. First guess still relies on user, would be good if program identified best initial guess.
